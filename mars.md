MyG4mes Age Rating System (MARS) is the age rating system for all MyG4mes content. If a game is rated over MARS 7, age confirmation is required to proceed to the game. There are 5 ratings:
* MARS 0 (suitable for everyone, green)
* MARS 7 (not suitable for pre-school children, sky blue)
* MARS 12 (suitable only for ages 12+, orange)
* MARS 16 (suitable only for ages 16+, red)
* MARS 18 (suitable only for adults, black)
* MARS RP (not yet rated, gray, does not apply to age confirmation)
* MARS E (exempt from classification, gray, does not apply to age confirmation)
* MARS RC (refused classification, only over 18s can proceed, black background with red text)

There are also content descriptors:
* Violence, game contains violence (must be rated 7, 12, 16 or 18 depending on how strong it is.)
* Fear, game is scary (appears as Fear on MARS 7 games with scary sounds or images or Horror on MARS 12 games with horrific content (but without violence)).
* Cloud Variables, one of the variables that are used in-game are set to "Cloud". May apply to games of any rating.
* Gambling, may contain gambling (MARS 18 or RC only).
* Bad Language, contains bad language or "swearing" (minimum of MARS 12, but does not apply to games with only very mild bad language).
