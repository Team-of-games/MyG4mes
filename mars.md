**M**yG4mes **A**ge **R**ating **S**ystem (**MARS**) is the age rating system for all MyG4mes content. If a game is rated over MARS 7, age confirmation is required to proceed to the game. There are 5 ratings:
* MARS 0 (suitable for everyone, green)
* MARS 7 (not suitable for pre-school children, sky blue)
* MARS 12 (suitable only for ages 12+, orange)
* MARS 16 (suitable only for ages 16+, red)
* MARS 18 (suitable only for adults, black)
* MARS RP (not yet rated, gray, does not apply to age confirmation)
* MARS E (exempt from classification, gray, does not apply to age confirmation)
* MARS RC (refused classification, only over 18s can proceed, black background with red text)

There are also content descriptors:
* Violence, game contains violence (must be rated 7, 12, 16 or 18 depending on how strong it is.)
* Fear, game is scary (appears as Fear on MARS 7 games with scary sounds or images or Horror on MARS 12 games with horrific content (but without violence)).
* Cloud Variables, one of the variables that are used in-game are set to "Cloud". May apply to games of any rating.
* Gambling, may contain gambling (MARS 18 or RC only).
* Bad Language, contains bad language or "swearing" (minimum of MARS 12, but does not apply to games with only very mild bad language).

## Ratings

#### MARS 0
MARS 0 games are suitable for everyone. They may contain cartoon violence, but will not get the MARS Violence descriptor. These games may also contain occasional non-sexual nudity. No bad language is allowed.

#### MARS 7
This is appllied to games with pictures or sounds likely to scare young children.

#### MARS 12
From 12, you need to confirm your age to play the games provided here. This is skipped only if the game is rated 0, 7, RP or E.

#### MARS 16 and 18
These games have strong violence. None of them are suitable for children or teenagers.

### Special ratings

#### MARS RC (Refused Classification)

Applies to games which were not rated for more than 90 days and may contain highly strong content. (Mildly strong content gets the E rating below instead.) Only over 18s can play these games, and an ID is requrired to play RC rated games as opposed to entering the birth year. A developer can appeal by emailing Tyler (the founder of all TOG games and that team), and we will remind on the repo's issues and get the TOG to rate the game.

#### MARS E (Exempt)

Games rated E are not rated by the TOG using our MARS system, but are exempt from classification.

#### Rating pending (RP)

This shows up on games that have **not** got assigned a final MARS rating. It may be used on testing games.

## Releasing a trailer or publishing an ad?

You need to place the rating on your trailer or ad. This is to let a child's parent know if the game is suitable for them.

## Auto-Ban

When a child or teenager under 18 attempts to play an RC rated game, he or she is automaticlly banned from sharing and playing games around the world. If a child or teenager wants to appeal, they must tell their parent to email Tyler (the founder of all TOG games).
