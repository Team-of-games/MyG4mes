DoYourG4me is a weekly challenge where you try to develop a game using MyG4mes.

Be careful:
* Your content may not:
  * Contain blood and/or gore, realistic violence, very fast flashing lights, or anything else that makes anyone feel uncomfortable.
  * Break our community guidelines, visit https://the-tog.github.io/MyG4mes/guidelines.
* Your game will be deleted 365 days from when you share it.
  * If the game is played, the time to delete will be reset. The game will then be deleted 365 days from the last play.
  * The game will only be deleted on the server. It will remain on another user's computer.

Games should be submitted to the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/The-TOG/MyG4mes/discussions) so the TOG's members know.
